      <h1>Austin's Spending Problem: When City Hall Dines at Sweetgreen and Asks You for a Tax Hike</h1>

      <p class="byline">By Nate McGuire</p>

      <p class="sources"><strong>Sources:</strong> <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2025/11/02/" target="_blank">Austin American-Statesman, Nov. 2 2025</a>; <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2025/07/30/" target="_blank">Austin American-Statesman, July 30 2025</a>; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/" target="_blank">New York Times, Nov. 2 2025</a></p>

      <p>As an Austin taxpayer, I want to believe our city leaders spend public money with restraint. But after reading through two new Statesman investigations and a New York Times feature, it's clear they've lost that discipline — and the trust that comes with it.</p>

      <p>While homeowners are being asked to approve a 20 percent property-tax increase through Proposition Q, members of the Austin City Council are quietly using nearly $900,000 each in annual office budgets for everything from Sweetgreen lunches to international junkets.</p>

      <h2>The Sweetgreen and Steak-Dinner Scandal</h2>

      <p>Back in July, the Statesman exposed how multiple city officials, including Council Member Ryan Alter, City Manager T.C. Broadnax, and staffers across departments, had been charging taxpayers for meals that would make most corporate auditors cringe — solo Sweetgreen orders, steak dinners, and "working lunches" at high-end restaurants.</p>

      <p>After the paper started asking questions, Alter reimbursed the city $1,200, including for a Sweetgreen lunch that city policy forbids being charged to public funds.</p>

      <p>It wasn't just an isolated mistake. That meal was part of a larger pattern that shows how loosely Austin's elected officials interpret "public purpose."</p>

      <h2>Ryan Alter's Pattern of Self-Promotion Spending</h2>

      <p>Alter recently presented a $100,000 "donation" to the Parks and Recreation Department — money pulled directly from his office account. He called it the result of "fiscal restraint," but it was really just unspent taxpayer money redirected for political optics.</p>

      <p>Records reviewed by the Statesman show Alter has spent nearly $10,000 in city funds on outside organizations, including Texas Gun Sense, Clean Water Action, the Liberal Austin Democrats, and even the Texas Bar Foundation, where he used $2,500 in public money to purchase a lifetime membership. The Bar Foundation describes that membership as one of the "highest honors" bestowed on attorneys — an honor usually paid for personally, not by taxpayers.</p>

      <p>Other Texas cities such as San Antonio explicitly ban political or nonprofit donations from city accounts, but Austin's vague policy lets officials spend freely as long as they can claim a "community benefit."</p>

      <h2>Vanessa Fuentes, Chito Vela, and the Travel Question</h2>

      <p>Council Member Vanessa Fuentes has spent over $10,000 on consultants, including $4,000 for "Latina Power" coaching and personality testing. Last week she was in Oita, Japan, leading a 27-person delegation to celebrate the city's sister-city anniversary — while voters back home debate whether to pay more in property taxes.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Chito Vela attended a transit conference in Portland, one of several recent taxpayer-funded trips by council members. These trips might have some civic value, but when city leaders are asking residents to shoulder higher taxes, the optics matter.</p>

      <h2>The Bigger Picture: Budgets, Salaries, and Entitlement</h2>

      <p>Each council office receives $898,000 a year, up 4.5 percent from last year, and members recently voted to raise their travel budgets by 55 percent and food allowances by 43 percent.</p>

      <p>They also gave themselves a 40 percent pay raise in 2022, bumping salaries to $116,000 — the only six-figure city-council pay in Texas. Houston council members earn $63,000. San Antonio's earn $77,000.</p>

      <p>The Statesman analysis concluded that Austin's spending policies are "about as minimal as you can get while still having a policy." The Texas Municipal League notes that gratuitous donations by a city are prohibited under the state constitution unless they meet a clear public purpose, yet Austin continues to blur that line.</p>

      <h2>"A Tax Hike for You, Perks for Them"</h2>

      <p>That headline from the Statesman says it all. While City Hall insists it needs more money for parks, housing, and homelessness, the council's own discretionary budgets are swelling — and the spending often looks more like self-promotion than service.</p>

      <p>Fiscal watchdog Andrew McVeigh put it bluntly:</p>

      <blockquote>"If you're being responsible with your budget, why are you transferring money into parks and rec and at the same time asking Austinites to pony up a 20 percent property-tax increase because you supposedly don't have enough money?"</blockquote>

      <h2>The View from Outside City Hall</h2>

      <p>The New York Times described the same dynamic in national terms. Its Nov. 2 story, "Austin Asked Voters to Raise Taxes for the Homeless. It's Not Going Well," reported that Proposition Q has become a referendum on trust in city government. Even progressive Austinites who normally back social spending are skeptical, worried that higher taxes will simply feed what one resident called the "homeless-industrial complex."</p>

      <p>The article quoted local activist Susana Almanza of PODER:</p>

      <blockquote>"We're just one step from becoming homeless ourselves. We feel like this additional increase will really hurt."</blockquote>

      <p>The message from both sides of the political spectrum is the same: Austin's problem isn't lack of money — it's lack of accountability.</p>

      <h2>A Call for Reform: Audit City Hall</h2>

      <p>Before asking residents for another $300 a year in property taxes, the Austin City Council should be subject to a full independent audit of every office budget — including travel, meals, memberships, and "donations."</p>

      <p>Austin should adopt a corporate-grade spending policy that includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear limits on discretionary purchases.</li>
        <li>A prohibition on political or nonprofit contributions.</li>
        <li>Written justification for any travel or training.</li>
        <li>Mandatory quarterly disclosure of all expenses.</li>
        <li>Automatic return of unspent office funds to the general fund.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If a private-sector manager used company funds for steak dinners, personal memberships, or overseas conferences without approval, they'd face consequences. City Hall should be held to the same standard.</p>

      <h2>Austin Deserves Better</h2>

      <p>Austin isn't broke. It's mismanaged. The same council that's spending public dollars on Sweetgreen salads, Harvard courses, and lifetime memberships is telling homeowners to pay more because the city "can't afford" basic services.</p>

      <p>It's time for leaders to set an example — not another tab.</p>

      <p><strong>We don't need higher taxes.<br>
      We need oversight, transparency, and a government that remembers who pays the bill.</strong></p>
