      <h1>The Austin City Council Scandal: $116,000 Salaries, Sweetgreen on Your Dime, and the Audacity to Demand a 20% Tax Hike</h1>

      <p class="byline">By Nate McGuire</p>

      <p><strong>They think you're stupid.</strong></p>

      <p>That's the only explanation for what Austin City Council members Ryan Alter, Vanessa Fuentes, and their colleagues have been doing with your money. While you're struggling to pay property taxes that have skyrocketed over the past decade, they're living like corporate executives — except corporate executives spend their own money, not yours.</p>

      <p>Two explosive investigations by the Austin American-Statesman have revealed a culture of entitlement, extravagance, and outright contempt for taxpayers at Austin City Hall. And now — in a display of breathtaking arrogance — these same officials are asking you to approve a <strong>20% property tax increase</strong> that will cost the average homeowner an extra $300 per year.</p>

      <p>Let that sink in. They want <em>you</em> to pay more while <em>they</em> spend your money on Japanese vacation junkets, "Latina Power" life coaches, and $2,500 lifetime memberships to exclusive attorney clubs.</p>

      <h2>Ryan Alter: Caught Red-Handed, Forced to Pay Back $1,200</h2>

      <p>In July, the Statesman caught Council Member Ryan Alter and City Manager T.C. Broadnax routinely charging taxpayers for personal meals — solo Sweetgreen orders, expensive steak dinners, and "working lunches" that violated city policy.</p>

      <p>Only after the newspaper started asking questions did Alter quietly reimburse the city $1,200. Think about that: he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and paid back the money <em>only because he was exposed</em>. How much taxpayer money has he spent that the Statesman hasn't uncovered yet?</p>

      <p>But the Sweetgreen scandal was just the appetizer. The main course is far more disturbing.</p>

      <h2>Ryan Alter's $10,000 Slush Fund: Buying Political Influence with Your Tax Dollars</h2>

      <p>Here's where it gets truly outrageous. Alter has been treating his taxpayer-funded office budget like a personal slush fund, funneling nearly <strong>$10,000 in public money</strong> to political organizations and advocacy groups that align with <em>his</em> ideology — not necessarily yours.</p>

      <p>The Statesman investigation revealed Alter spent YOUR money on:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liberal Austin Democrats</strong> — a partisan political organization</li>
        <li><strong>Texas Gun Sense</strong> — a gun control advocacy group</li>
        <li><strong>Clean Water Action</strong> — an environmental advocacy group</li>
        <li><strong>$2,500 for a lifetime membership to the Texas Bar Foundation</strong> — described by the organization as "one of the highest honors" for attorneys, typically paid for <em>personally</em>, not with public funds</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let's be crystal clear: <strong>San Antonio explicitly bans this kind of spending.</strong> Other major Texas cities prohibit council members from donating public funds to outside organizations. But Austin's conveniently vague policy lets Alter and his colleagues spend freely as long as they can claim a "community benefit."</p>

      <p>Translation: As long as they can come up with a good excuse, they can spend your money however they want.</p>

      <p>And then there's the photo-op "donation." Alter recently presented a giant ceremonial check for <strong>$100,000 to the Parks Department</strong> — money from his office budget that he called the result of "fiscal restraint." But wait: if you had $100,000 in unspent taxpayer funds lying around, why are you asking homeowners to pay 20% more in property taxes?</p>

      <h2>Vanessa Fuentes: $4,000 for "Latina Power" Coaching While You Can't Afford Groceries</h2>

      <p>If you thought Alter's spending was bad, wait until you hear about Council Member Vanessa Fuentes.</p>

      <p>Fuentes has burned through more than <strong>$10,000 in taxpayer money on "consultants,"</strong> including <strong>$4,120 for a "Latina Power" career coach</strong> for personality testing and one-on-one coaching sessions. That's right — while working families are choosing between paying their mortgage and filling up their gas tank, Fuentes is using your tax dollars for personal life coaching.</p>

      <p>But she wasn't done. Just last week, as voters prepared to decide on a massive tax increase, Fuentes was living it up in <strong>Oita, Japan</strong>, leading a 27-person delegation to celebrate a "sister-city anniversary." The timing couldn't be more insulting: You're being asked to pay more taxes, and she's on a taxpayer-funded vacation to Japan.</p>

      <p>Her defense? The trip had "civic value." Tell that to the Austin families who can't afford to take their kids to Six Flags, let alone Japan.</p>

      <h2>Mike Siegel and Chito Vela: First-Class Travel on Your Dime</h2>

      <p>Council Member Mike Siegel took office in January and immediately got to work spending your money. In his first 10 months, he's already dropped <strong>$7,200 on consultants</strong>, <strong>$2,800 on furniture</strong> (the most among his peers), and <strong>$2,000 on decorative artwork</strong> for his office.</p>

      <p>And just weeks before Election Day, Siegel flew to <strong>Germany</strong> for a biodiversity conference in Berlin — on your dime. Austinites struggling with inflation and rising property taxes couldn't make the trip. But Siegel could, because he's spending <em>your</em> money, not his own.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Chito Vela jetted off to Portland for a transit conference. These international junkets might sound nice on paper, but the timing is grotesque: Don't ask taxpayers to tighten their belts while you're loosening yours at 35,000 feet.</p>

      <h2>The Bigger Picture: Austin Has the Highest-Paid, Most Pampered City Council in Texas</h2>

      <p>Let's zoom out and look at just how entitled Austin's City Council has become.</p>

      <p><strong>Office Budgets: $898,000 per member, per year</strong><br>
      That's nearly $900,000 for EACH council member to spend on staff, consultants, life coaches, international travel, artwork, and apparently whatever else they feel like. And this year, they voted to increase those budgets by 4.5%.</p>

      <p>They also voted to give themselves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>55% increase in travel budgets</strong></li>
        <li><strong>43% increase in food allowances</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Salaries: $116,000 — The ONLY Six-Figure Council Salaries in Texas</strong><br>
      In 2022, the Austin City Council quietly gave themselves a <strong>40% pay raise</strong>, jumping from $83,000 to $116,000. No other major Texas city comes close:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Houston City Council:</strong> $63,000 (serves 212,000 constituents per member)</li>
        <li><strong>San Antonio City Council:</strong> $77,000</li>
        <li><strong>Austin City Council:</strong> $116,000 (serves fewer than 100,000 constituents per member)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Austin council members earn <strong>nearly double</strong> what Houston's do — while serving <em>half</em> as many people and spending <em>three times</em> as much per constituent.</p>

      <p>The Statesman's analysis says it all: Austin's spending policies are "about as minimal as you can get while still having a policy." Translation: There are basically no rules, and council members can do whatever they want.</p>

      <h2>The Hypocrisy Is Staggering: Asking You to Pay More While They Live High on the Hog</h2>

      <p>Here's the bottom line that should make every Austin taxpayer furious:</p>

      <p><strong>City Council claims Austin is broke and desperately needs a 20% property tax increase.</strong></p>

      <p>But at the same time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ryan Alter had $100,000 in leftover office budget money lying around for a publicity stunt</li>
        <li>Council members are spending thousands on life coaches, consultants, and decorative artwork</li>
        <li>They're jetting off to Japan and Germany on taxpayer-funded "educational" trips</li>
        <li>They just gave themselves a 55% travel budget increase and 43% food budget increase</li>
        <li>They're earning $116,000 salaries — the highest in Texas — for part-time work</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Fiscal watchdog Andrew McVeigh captured the absurdity perfectly:</p>

      <blockquote>"If you're being responsible with your budget, why are you transferring money into parks and rec and at the same time asking Austinites to pony up a 20 percent property-tax increase because you supposedly don't have enough money?"</blockquote>

      <p>The answer is simple: <strong>They're not being responsible.</strong> They're being reckless, entitled, and contemptuous of the people who pay their salaries.</p>

      <h2>Even the New York Times Noticed: "It's Not Going Well"</h2>

      <p>The spending scandal has become so egregious that even the <em>New York Times</em> took notice. In a Nov. 2 story headlined "Austin Asked Voters to Raise Taxes for the Homeless. It's Not Going Well," the paper reported that Proposition Q has become a referendum on whether Austin voters still trust their city government.</p>

      <p>Spoiler alert: <strong>They don't.</strong></p>

      <p>Even lifelong progressives who normally support social spending are voting NO, worried that higher taxes will just feed what one resident called the "homeless-industrial complex" — bureaucrats and consultants getting rich while the actual problems get worse.</p>

      <p>Local activist Susana Almanza of PODER put it plainly:</p>

      <blockquote>"We're just one step from becoming homeless ourselves. We feel like this additional increase will really hurt."</blockquote>

      <p>Think about that. Working-class Austinites are worried they'll become homeless themselves — while City Council members are spending $4,000 on life coaches and flying to Japan.</p>

      <p>The message from voters across the political spectrum is loud and clear: <strong>Austin doesn't have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. And an accountability problem. And a leadership problem.</strong></p>

      <h2>What Needs to Happen: A Complete Audit and Overhaul</h2>

      <p>Before Austin City Council gets ONE MORE DOLLAR from taxpayers, here's what needs to happen:</p>

      <p><strong>1. Independent Forensic Audit</strong><br>
      Every council office budget should be subject to a full independent audit. Every meal, every trip, every "donation," every consultant payment. All of it. And the results should be made public.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Adopt Real Spending Rules (Like San Antonio Has)</strong><br>
      Austin needs a corporate-grade spending policy that includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Absolute ban on political or nonprofit donations from public funds</strong></li>
        <li>Clear, enforceable limits on discretionary purchases</li>
        <li>Written justification required for ALL travel and training</li>
        <li>Mandatory monthly public disclosure of all expenses</li>
        <li>Automatic return of unspent office funds to the general fund — NO more $100,000 "donations" for photo ops</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>3. Accountability</strong><br>
      If a private-sector manager used company funds the way Ryan Alter and Vanessa Fuentes have used taxpayer dollars — Sweetgreen lunches, life coaches, personal bar memberships, political donations — they'd be fired and possibly prosecuted.</p>

      <p>City Hall should be held to the <em>same</em> standard. Higher, actually, since it's public money.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line: Vote NO on Proposition Q</h2>

      <p>Austin isn't broke. <strong>Austin is mismanaged.</strong></p>

      <p>The same council members who are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Charging you for their Sweetgreen lunches</li>
        <li>Spending $4,000 on "Latina Power" coaching</li>
        <li>Flying to Japan and Germany on your dime</li>
        <li>Donating $10,000 to political organizations you might not even support</li>
        <li>Earning $116,000 salaries (the highest in Texas) for part-time work</li>
        <li>Giving themselves 55% travel budget increases</li>
      </ul>

      <p>...are now telling you the city is broke and you need to pay 20% more in property taxes.</p>

      <p><strong>They're lying.</strong></p>

      <p>The problem isn't that Austin doesn't have enough money. The problem is that Austin City Council spends money like drunken sailors — except sailors spend their own money, and council members are spending <em>yours.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Until City Hall proves it can manage the money it already has, it doesn't deserve one more penny.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Vote NO on Proposition Q. Then demand accountability.</strong></p>
